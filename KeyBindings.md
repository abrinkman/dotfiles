* Cmd + p 								Find in project
* Cmd + d 								Find and highlight, repetitive for multiple cursors

* Cmd + Shift + up/down		Move line up/down
* Cmd + Shift + l 				Cursor on every selected line*

* Cmd + Alt + left/right 	Next/Prev Tab

* Cmd + Cntl + p 					Switch Project

* Cntl + j  							JSHint

### Debugger
* Next 			n

### Still to figure out
